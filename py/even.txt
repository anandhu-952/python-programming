London Bridge is falling down,
London Bridge is falling down,

Wood and clay, wood and clay,
My fair lady.
Wood and clay will wash away,
Wood and clay will wash away,

Iron and steel, iron and steel,
My fair lady.
Iron and steel will bend and bow,
Iron and steel will bend and bow,

Silver and gold, silver and gold,
My fair lady.
